<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
This page shows real-time weather data around the Wellington region, so the 
<a href="http://groups.google.co.nz/group/wellingtonkitesurfers?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&pli=1">kitesurfers</a> 
would know when it's time to get down to the beach.
</p>
<p>
This page relies on pulling together data from a number of public data feeds. The data is only as good 
as those feeds so if you see some odd numbers, click on the "Source" link to see if the problem is with 
the original data. If the problem still seems to be this page then get in touch and I'll try and fix it.
</p>
<p>
The data I've pulled together is available as a JSON formatted file <a href="data.json">here</a>. It 
currently updates every 15 minutes on the quarter hour.
</p>
<p>
The "Time ago" column lists how long ago the displayed data was observed (the time of the actual measurement, 
not just when it was collected by my script). Observations older than 20 minutes are orange, and those older 
than four hours are red to warn they are out of date.
</p>
<p>
Click on the "Map" link to see where the stations are located.
</p>
<p>
The page automatically reloads when new data is expected to be available. The countdown indicator shows when 
that will be.
